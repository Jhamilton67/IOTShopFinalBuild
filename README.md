# IOTShopFinalBuild
This is the Final Build Version of my HonoursProject, I created another repo for this program but the HTTPS back ending calling methods some how corrupted when i was minipulating the data and trying out new things. So this is a stable Final build of my Application 

Iot-Shop has been designed to use RFID sensor, PIR sensor and Ultra Sonic range sensor to collect data. This Program has been designed to help companies' boost productivity levels, while using these, Sensors. Iot-Shop has been created using multiple frameworks, Programming language and a distributed Architecture Style
Iot-Shops Front End is connected to an Arduino C++ Project, A data Class library, local Database, Blazor Server side Front End and an API.
The way that the program works is that it uses the Arduino project code to connect to the Sensors then storing and view the data that the sensors have read/outputted to the programs UI.
